In preparation for the interview you should make sure you have:

- A computer set up with an editor/IDE you're comfortable in
- A browser with the right OS permissions to do screen sharing on Google meet (to test, go to meet.google.com, start a new instant meeting and try presenting your screen)
- node.js installed locally

And optionally to prepare, briefly review:
  - express js
  - html forms
  - dom manipulation with plain html
  - browser native fetch function
  - the [sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) node package (async wrapper for 'sqlite3')
  - [SQLite language docs](https://sqlite.org/lang.html)
